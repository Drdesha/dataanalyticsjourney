My learning diary documenting SQL, BigQuery, and Looker Studio projects
# 🧠 My Data Analytics Learning Journey

Welcome to my data analytics project diary!  
This space documents my progress as I learn to use SQL, BigQuery, and Looker Studio to turn data into real insights.

## 📘 Project 1: NCAA Top Player Rankings + TheLook E-Commerce

Goal:  
Combine data from Google’s public NCAA Basketball dataset and TheLook eCommerce dataset to help a marketing team identify which NCAA players and swimwear products to feature in a summer ad campaign.

Tools Used:  
- Google BigQuery (SQL queries)
- Looker Studio (Dashboards & Visuals)
- Google Cloud Platform

Highlights:  
- Queried `thelook_gcda` dataset for June 2023 swimwear sales  
- Queried `ncaa_basketball` public dataset for top-scoring players  
- Built visual dashboards to link athlete performance and product sales  

Screenshots:

Key Insights:  
- Top-selling products were those tied to NCAA athletes in ad creative  
- 3-player segments outperformed baseline clickthrough by 14% (simulated data)  
- Future recommendation: integrate time-series analysis to anticipate campaign lift  

What I Learned:  
- How to write and optimize SQL queries in BigQuery  
- How to connect datasets across domains (sports + retail)  
- The power of visual storytelling with Looker Studio
