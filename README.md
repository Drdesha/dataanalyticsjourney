# 🧠 My Data Analytics Learning Journey

Welcome to my data analytics project diary!  
This space documents my progress as I learn to use SQL, BigQuery, and Looker Studio to turn data into real insights.

---# Data Analytics Portfolio – NCAA & TheLook SQL Project

### Overview
This project explores data from **TheLook eCommerce** dataset and the **NCAA Basketball** public dataset using **Google BigQuery** and **Looker Studio**.  
The goal was to help a marketing team identify which NCAA athletes and swimwear products to feature in a summer ad campaign.

### Objectives
- Query swimwear product sales from June 2023 in the TheLook dataset.  
- Retrieve the highest-ranking NCAA basketball players.  
- Combine both insights to guide marketing decisions for a new product campaign.

### Tools & Skills Used
- **Google BigQuery** – SQL queries and data filtering  
- **Looker Studio** – Dashboards and visualizations  
- **Data Cleaning & Aggregation** – Using SELECT, WHERE, GROUP BY, ORDER BY
